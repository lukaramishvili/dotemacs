//  Use this file to import your target's public headers that you would like to expose to Swift.

// Note

// It's best practice to link your project using the $(SRCROOT) macro so that if you move your project, or work on it with others using a remote repository, it will still work. $(SRCROOT) can be thought of as the directory that contains your .xcodeproj file. It might look like this:

// $(SRCROOT)/Folder/Folder/<#YourProjectName#>-Bridging-Header.h
